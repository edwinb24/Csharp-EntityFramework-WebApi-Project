# Csharp-EntityFramework-WepApi-Project
Starting Project to learn the basis of C#, Entity Framework, and WebApi.

12-26-15: Start working in the project, get into some difficulties with running Visual Studio 2013. I keep getting into an error when attempting to open the templates for ASP.Net Web Application describe as follow: "Visual Studio does not have permission to read the template information from the system registry. This is often caused by registry permission problems." Attempted to run the program with my Anti-Virus turn off. Attempted by repairing the software through the control panel programs and features and uninstalling the software and reinstalling the software. After attempted to uninstall the software and run a registry clean process according to the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stykuu7kT_4 which caused the computer to lose access to any folder or program and require me to restart the computer from a previous functional state. 

12-27-15: When ahead and attempt installing the Visual Studio 2015 version, and run into the same inconvenience. I attempted with uninstalling the software and any related component and running a registry cleaner, this time through the use of Wise Registry Cleaner a downloadable registry cleaner software. After cleaning the register, I installed the software again and attempt to run the software again receiving the same message when I tried to open the template.
